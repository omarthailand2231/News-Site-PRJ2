    <p>the Department of Environmental Affairs announced today a new set of regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the industrial sector.
    The measures, which include stricter limits on factory pollutants and expanded incentives for green energy adoption, are expected to roll out over the next 18 months.
    Officials say the policy shift reflects both mounting international pressure and a nationwide demand for more aggressive environmental action. In a press conference held earlier this morning,
    Environment Minister Arisa Kulchai emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that “delayed action is no longer an option.” While environmental advocacy groups largely welcomed the initiative,
    several manufacturing associations expressed concern over the potential economic impact, calling for additional government support during the transition.
    The policy package will next be reviewed by the national legislative committee in early September
     with public hearings scheduled to follow.</p>
